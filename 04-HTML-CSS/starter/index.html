      So I've slept for barely 2 hours today. My study could be affected today,
      but I'll try my best. Life can get pretty tough sometimes.

    <h3>I like books</h3>
    <p class="second">
      Just throwing another paragraph here. So, I really like this one book
      series called the Poppy War Trilogy. It's written by R.F. Kuang, and it is
      a fantasy novel series.
